# gemOCR
Extracts harcodded subtitles from a video using Gemini.

## How it works
##### Once the initial setup is done...
Just drag and drop a video to *gemOCR.py* (or a bat/sh file calling it)
<br>or execute `python gemOCR.py "video file"` and it will automatically do the following:

- Scan for subtitles using VideoSubFinder in CLI mode.
- Create a folder with the name of the video with a `top` and a `bot` subfolders containing the timed screenshots generated by VSF.
- Ask you to delete the unwanted screenshots (optional, but highly recommended) and press *Enter* to continue.
- Convert the .jpeg files into pages of a PDF file and ask Gemini to OCR each of those pages as a JSON {"key":"value"} pair.
- ~~Convert and merge the JSON files to plain text and add a {\an8} tag to the upper dialogues.~~ [Not yet]
- ~~Crate an .ass subtitle fle based on the content~~. [Not yet]

## Requirements
- Windows 10/11 or Linux
- Python
- VideoSubFinder
- [A Gemini API Key](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
```
pip install google-genai
```

## TODO
- Ditch VideoSubFinder for some custom-made OpenCV-based script maybe?
- Gemma 3 support for local OCR processing
