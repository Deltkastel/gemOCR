# gemOCR
Subtitle OCR using Gemini and VideoSubFinder

## Usage
Just drag and drop a video to *gemOCR.py* or execute
`python gemOCR.py "video file"` and it will do the following:
- Scan for subtitles using VideoSubFinder in CLI mode
- Create a folder with the name of the video with a `top` and `bot` subfolders containing the timmed screenshots generated by VSF
-
